# FreshWorks Assignment
Build a file-based key-value data store that supports the basic CRD (create, read, and delete)
operations. This data store is meant to be used as a local storage for one single process on one
laptop. The data store must be exposed as a library to clients that can instantiate a class and work
with the data store.

# The data store will support the following functional requirements.
1. It can be initialized using an optional file path. If one is not provided, it will reliably
create itself in a reasonable location on the laptop.
2. A new key-value pair can be added to the data store using the Create operation. The key
is always a string - capped at 32chars. The value is always a JSON object - capped at
16KB.
3. If Create is invoked for an existing key, an appropriate error must be returned.
4. A Read operation on a key can be performed by providing the key, and receiving the
value in response, as a JSON object.
5. A Delete operation can be performed by providing the key.
6. Every key supports setting a Time-To-Live property when it is created. This property is
optional. If provided, it will be evaluated as an integer defining the number of seconds
the key must be retained in the data store. Once the Time-To-Live for a key has expired,
the key will no longer be available for Read or Delete operations.
7. Appropriate error responses must always be returned to a client if it uses the data store in
unexpected ways or breaches any limits.

### This project can be used as library/API by downloading the JAR file and adding it into the external libraries

#### FreshW/src/MainClass.java has been written as an example to make you understand how to use this project as a Library to perform the C,R,D Operations.
